## 1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing is the delivery of online services (such as servers, databases, software) which enables a user to focus on their projects and customers without worrying about infrastructure concerns. It not only saves time, money, and effort but also allows users to concentrate on more pressing aspects of their business.

There is a great deal of interest from those with traditional IT skills—such as enterprise architects, developers, and networking engineers—to steer themselves into a cloud computing career that will not only provide job protection, but pay better as well.

## 2. What is AWS?
Amazon Web Service (AWS) is an online platform that provides scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions. 

AWS offers every benefit you’d expect from the cloud, and is vastly superior to other cloud service providers in the market in terms of data availability and high-transfer stability.
