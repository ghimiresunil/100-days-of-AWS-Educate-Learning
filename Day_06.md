# 2. Amazon Database Service

AWS offers purpose-built databases for all your application needs. 

* Relational Database: Store data with predefined schemas and “relationships” between the tables, hence the “Relational” name. It is designed to support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions with strong data consistency to maintain referential integrity.
* Key-value databases: Suitable for storing and retrieving large volumes of data. It delivers quick response times even in large volumes of concurrent requests. 
* In-memory databases: Primarily used for applications that require real-time access to data. It is capable of delivering data to applications in microseconds and not just in milliseconds since the data are directly stored in memory and not on disk.

Note: AWS also offers Document, Time Series, Ledger, and many other database types. You would most likely have a database service that you can use.
